# cs231n
Assignments of Stanford course cs231n-Spring 2017 have been solved in this repository.

The notebook files have been translated to python files for the assignment. It is ideal for people who don't have access to Jupyter Notebook and Linux system for carrying out the assignements.

Initial setup:
1. Install anaconda on your system.
2. Create a virtual env in the anaconda prompt. The command is conda create -n "ENVIRONMENT_NAME" python=x.x anaconda #virtual environment name is ENVIRONMENT_NAME
3. activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME
4. Install the dependencies present in "requirements.txt" in your environment. You can use conda install --file requirements.txt command in your environment to achieve the same.
5. The setup is complete. Now each time you open your assignment, just activate the virtual environment (use command in step 3) and goto the required location in the conda prompt. You can access the relevant files either by executing "jupyter notebook" (to access .ipynb) or by opening spyder by executing the "spyder" (to open .py files) command in the conda prompt.
